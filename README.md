## T-Mobile-Hackathon-2019-Oct
we are doing a gesture recognition as the input of AR
#The idea for this is to use hand gesture to control a dancer in an Ios App.


We used machine learning algorithm to train a model and use coreMl to convert it.


We achieved developed an Ios app called Hacktober which can use control the Ar dancer to dance when clicking the screen and choose a position for it.
